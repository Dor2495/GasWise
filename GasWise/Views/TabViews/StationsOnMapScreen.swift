/// A view that will display gas stations on a map.
///
/// `StationOnMapScreen` is planned to provide a geographic visualization of gas stations
/// that the user has visited or recorded in the app. The view will eventually support:
/// - Interactive map interface
/// - Gas station location markers
/// - Price comparison between stations
/// - Navigation capabilities
///
/// This feature is currently under development and will be implemented in a future version.
struct StationOnMapScreen: View {
    /// The body of the StationOnMapScreen defining its UI.
    var body: some View {
        Text("Coming soon...")
